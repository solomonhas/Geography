# Geography


Geography Flag game, shows a set ammount of flags, from 2-10. Prompts the user to click on the correct flag for the random country.
Settings tab that allows the user to set the ammount of flags, or if US States are included. Includes a basic streak counter.

This is source code, the website can be found on my [website]https://www.solomonhas.com currently.


## Usage

This program uses various data from [flagpedia.net]https://flagpedia.net/. Including public domain images of flags and the ISO 3166 Country Codes found in Geography\dist\codes.json.

## Future Updates
I plan to add a country outline part of the quiz, where it shows an outline of a country and you have to either click the name or the flag.

I have thought about adding hints, for example the capitol city or ???. Not sure yet.
